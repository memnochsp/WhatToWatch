What to Watch, SWIFT 'Navigation and Workflow' submission
Working through RMIT's SWIFT online course, this was my submission for the third of 5. 
The brief was to have an app that users would be presented with a selection of 2-3 choices for things to get recommendations from.
They would then be presented with a series of questions that would ultimately give them a recommendation. The topics/questions were arbitary,
it was more about the workflow and navigation of multiple screens.
